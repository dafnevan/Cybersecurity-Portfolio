Class today was a continuation of learning from the previous day with Adam Bricker. Adam showed us a video about building better habits. However, I couldn't keep my eyes open. I felt so sleepless with just sleeping 5 hours a day. I could still make out every words Adam is saying but I couldn't keep my head up and after every few minutes, my eyes would start to close. Adam then called me out but jokingly said that I am falling asleep because he is boring me. I then stated "that's why one of the habit I am trying to commit to is going to sleep earlier." I did felt somewhat embarassed but the way that Adam handled the situation made me realized that I should really come to class with more energy and focus.
